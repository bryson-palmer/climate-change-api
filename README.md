# Climate Data API ðŸŒŽ

### Unofficial API collection of scraped climate stories and climate vital signs from [NASA](https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change). ðŸš€ 

### App: [climate-data.vercel.app](https://climate-data.vercel.app)

  I built this API collection so that developers could have easy access to NASA climate data for their own projects. It's conveniently set up so a developer can build some climate news cards or a banner of climate vital signs. The [docs](https://climate-data.vercel.app) are located on the home route. I wanted to gain some experience using scraping functionality, vercel serverless functions, and Three.js 3D library. I am a fan of NASA and space exploration. This was a fun way to merge it with my passion for programming. Program responsibly and enjoy!
